# day-scheduler
FEATURE ROADMAP: 
    - Remove tasks from list (complete)
    - local storage of task list (complete)
    - "begin" button functionality: 
        - loads new page (complete)
        - loads list with timers & real time (complete)
        - display current task (complete)
        - interactable (button or onclick) to 'complete' task

LOW PRIORITY:
    - Use useCallback and react memo to optimize task list
