# day-scheduler
FEATURE ROADMAP: 
    - Remove tasks from list (complete)
    - local storage of task list (complete)
    - "begin" button functionality: 
        - loads new page
        - loads list with timers & real time
        - display current task

LOW PRIORITY:
    - Use useCallback and react memo to optimize task list
